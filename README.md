# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This code implements a handwritten digit recognizer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras. The MNIST dataset, containing grayscale images of hand-drawn digits (0-9) and corresponding labels, is utilized. The code starts by loading and preprocessing the training and test datasets. The pixel values are normalized, and the data is reshaped to fit the CNN input format. The CNN model is then built with Convolutional and Dense layers and compiled with an optimizer and loss function. It is trained on the training data with a validation set for evaluation. After training, the model's performance is assessed on the validation set using metrics like loss and accuracy. Subsequently, the model predicts labels on the validation set and calculates evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A classification report and confusion matrix are generated and visualized to analyze the model's performance comprehensively. Finally, the trained model is used to predict labels on the test dataset, and sample test images along with their predicted labels are displayed. The predictions are saved in a CSV file named "predictions_hdr.csv" for further use.
